The Free Marketplace of Ideas is a student-run, student-led organization/blog website aiming to promote free discourse on politics.

We are currently open for submissions. Email your article to freemarketplaceofideaswebsite@gmail.com and include the name or pseudonym you would like to go under. Inappropriate or hateful submissions, or submissions that are irrelevant to issues of politics or philosophy, will not be pubished.

This is not a school organized community and it is not monitored by a staff member. However, the Student Code of Conduct does apply here.
