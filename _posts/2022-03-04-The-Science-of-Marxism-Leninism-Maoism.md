(Note, MLM, Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, and Maoism mean the same thing in this article. When referencing Marxists, it will refer to Marxists before the synthesis of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism)

Just like Lenin had to deal with the opportunists and the falsifiers of his time, we must deal with the same in the present day. There are many people out there who reject the fundamental truths about reality and this ideology, namely:

Marxism-Leninism-Maoism (MLM), is a science

The falsifiers of Marxism, of which today there are all too many sadly, will renege on this. Some will call it a guideline or a framework; some will say it is not an overarching social science; taking whatever excuse possible to deny its truth. These must be swept away if we are to build a truly socialist society. Not only this, but we must also combat the dogmatists and the revisionists among us, who, while accepting dialectical materialism, refuse to engage in its proper application. This article will make a solid case that MLM is in fact a science and that those who would deny so are simply incorrect. It is the correct view of the progression of history and of society, and we shall also show the correct attitude to have towards it.

Kicking off this article, I will outline what constitutes a science, afterwards I will justify why MLM qualifies as one. After this, I will justify the base axioms used within the field. With this complete, I shall briefly discuss dogmatism and revisionism and why they are incorrect attitudes to take towards MLM, and with that, my case will be complete.

What is a science? What constitutes any field of study as one? This is the first question we must answer if we are to confirm MLM as belonging to this category. For the purposes of this article, a science will be defined as

Science is a discipline that covers an array of phenomena and discerns general truths around them, as justified by the scientific method. 

The scientific method is a systemized methodology utilized to collect evidence which leads to the formation of justified conclusions. Conclusions and theories formulated through this method when tested can be either verified or falsified. 

The scientific method has 4 major requirements.
You can make applicable predictions
It has consistent laws and axioms
You can make conclusions based on observations
Theories can be proven correct or incorrect using experiments

Having laid out the definition of science, let us see if MLM is a science in its own right. To begin, let us justify it based on the first portion of our definition. Does this science seek to find general truths about a certain array of phenomena? Certainly! MLM concerns itself with the development and growth of societies, economics, and politics, the three of which are inextricably linked. 

Now let us go to the second point, does MLM follow the scientific method? We must check off the four bullet points in order to verify this.

Can one make applicable predictions with MLM? Yes! Let us look at some that prominent Marxists made that ring true today
The Paris commune would fail
The fall of the rate of profit
The tendency towards monopolization
The boom and bust cycle
The revolution would begin in Russia
The international character of capitalism would intensify
And this is just a small sample of many correct predictions Marxists have made!

Now onto the next point, does Marxism-Leninism-Maoism have consistent laws and axioms? Yes, it does! Maoism is based on dialectical materialism, the underlying science that explains all sciences and all of reality. An in-depth explanation for this is for another time, however, although it will be briefly expanded on later. The base science of Maoism itself is historical materialism, which is based upon a few axioms. These axioms are:
Society and history can be understood scientifically
Material production is the basis of social life, and social consciousness stems from social being
That society and history are made by the masses
The material conditions set limits to changes that can be made in society
That social classes exist based on people's relations to the means of production
The history of society since ancient society is the history of class struggle
That at a certain point the material productive forces come into conflict with the relations of production in society, and at that point the era of social revolution begins
Society must ultimately progress to a state of communism where classes no longer exist
Between capitalism and communism there must be a transitionary period, socialism, in which we have a dictatorship of the proletariat
Within different areas of Maoism there are also organizing subtheories, so this requirement for a science is true. These axioms will be justified after confirming that MLM is in fact a science.

The next requirement is for MLM to be able to make conclusions based on observations. Well, the thing is, Maoism itself is a set of conclusions based upon observations! Lenin and Mao drew on their observations of society around them to explain what was going on with imperialism, and Mao’s mass line was him using observations from the masses to deduce theories on what policies would work towards socialism. So yes, the conclusions within our science are based on observations of the world around us, therefore this requirement is satisfied. 

Now for the final condition, can the theories within Maoism be proven false using experiments? Yes! Marx had an improper understanding of imperialism, this understanding was amended by Lenin and Mao, who built on it using the evidence in their day. They were also incorrect about the role of the working class in the imperial core, and yet again it was resolved by later marxists. If Mao and Lenin were incorrect about some of their positions and evidence displayed this, future Maoists will criticize and learn from their mistakes, while creating new theories based on whatever evidence is around. So yes, theories within Maoism are falsifiable and as such it meets the last characteristic.

With all this in mind, we can conclude that Marxism-Leninism-Maoism is in fact a science

Now it is true that earlier in the article we made some specific pre-existing assumptions and axioms that we use to justify the rest of this theory. In order to properly justify it as not only a science, but a real and practical science, we must either confirm or justify the use of our axioms. To begin, let us take a brief look  at dialectical materialism, which is the science of not only maoism, but a science of the most abstract sense. Dialectical materialism is made up of two parts. Dialectics, and materialism (truly illuminatory I know). Let us analyze these two components.

Materialism is the philosophical idea that matter, in all cases, is primary. All sciences must inherently be based upon materialism, since they attempt to make material predictions about the natural world based on the natural world itself. They do not look at the will of people as influencing the natural world, but at material causes creating material impacts. If all serious sciences are material, then it stands to reason that the underlying laws of reality will also be based in materialist analysis.

Dialectics is a system of logic. It is what is applied to material reality to create conceptions and knowledge about the world around us. It seeks to understand the relations, connections, concatenations, and consequences in a world where everything is inherently connected and affects each other. By seeing different material facts and analyzing them in conjunction with one another, we can arrive at a certain synthesis or conclusion about material reality, and then test this conclusion against new evidence. This logical process can continue until we get the correct theory of reality. Therefore dialectical materialism is objective, it is simply the application of logic to reality. 

Now with the underlying theory of dialectical materialism established, we can examine how it specifically applies to the Marxist theories of history. Let us go back to the axioms we have within this theory:

Society and history can be understood scientifically
If we are to accept the basic premise of materialism, that matter is primary, this leap is very simple to make. Not only that, but we make this inherent assumption in all sciences, that the world can be understood through the means of logic, and this assumption forms the premise for historical materialism. Without this premise, there is no point to any sort of scientific analysis of history, so this axiom is both intuitive, as if science can govern the primary material world it makes sense that scientific laws can govern society, as well as necessary for any real analysis.

Material production is the basis of social life, and social consciousness stems from social being
This stems from our base theory of historical materialism. Let us analyze it more to see what exactly it posits. Historical materialism states that matter is primary in history for our analysis of it, therefore to analyze the progression of history rather than understand the personal psyches of great men, we must understand the objective material conditions of different eras in history. This seems a fairly reasonable jump in logic to make. 
Now when we look at history we have to see, what objective natural conditions exist that can influence history and the creation of societies? Now when brainstorming, one can come up with a variety of potential factors, such as race, gender, etc. But now the question is: have these shaped societies at the base level? Is race, a socially constructed idea, something that has generated our society, or is it something generated by society? What about gender, are gender roles something that is prescriptive and precedes society, or is it something that is created as a product of it? The answer is both of these are in fact products of our society, and while one can bring up psychology, to state that human will is what creates society is idealism, and idealism is not materialist, therefore not scientific. The thing that influences human society is again, the natural world and the primary way that humanity interacts with the natural world is the gaining of resources from it. So in that case, we must understand that if we accept the previous statement and understand that the way humanity interacts with the natural world is through material production, we must therefore cede that material production shapes society.

Now as for social consciousness, one's social beliefs within society cannot be spawned of thin air. They must be based on that individual's material reality, or their social being. It stands to intuition that the social being must determine an individual's social consciousness. Not only that, but if we understand that societies are formed by the mode of production within a society, one’s position within a specific mode of production is what shapes their social being, therefore forming their social consciousness.

That society and history are made by the masses
Let us look once again, now what force in society is powerful enough to influence society and create history? Of all the great revolutions, regardless of whatever material changes in the methods of production, who enacts these changes on a societal level? It was the masses that broke the chains of feudalism, the masses that fought slavery, and it will be the masses who liberate thesmeleves from the chains of capital. The masses drive history, as they are the only group that has the power and the will to. Even the bourgeois had to align with them in order to bring about the society of capital from that of the feudal mode of production. 

The material conditions set limits to changes that can be made in society
If we go back to our theory of historical materialism and understand that the material reality of production is what governs the development of society, this conclusion becomes self-evident. That since material reality governs the development and growth of society, without certain material circumstances certain societies cannot be created. You cannot create bourgeois society without the material conditions allowing the bourgeois mode of production.

That social classes exist based on people's relations to the means of production
This is more a definitional thing but can be expanded on if we look at objective material existence for different peoples. A social class is, inherently, defined by a group's relation to the means of production. The nobility was defined by its ownership of the land the serfs used to cultivate, as the bourgeois are defined by their ownership of the factories the working class uses to create goods. This ownership gives them power over society, as the ability to control productive forces, the fundamental building block of our society. The ruling class, able to exert their will over these instruments, has society built up around them and as such is able to benefit from this arrangement, generally leading to the social stratification we see today.

The history of society since ancient society is the history of class struggle
Now that we understand how societies are formed, what changes them? How do they change and shift along with the relations of production in order to create new societies? Well first we have to understand what can change a society. If society is to change, a certain group must strive to change it. Only a specific class, a class with the power of the masses, has its ability to enforce its will upon society. Yet the class in power will oppose any change, as they stand to benefit from the currently existing relations of production. This leads to struggle between the classes, as both seek to implement their diametrically opposed visions of society. Ergo, class struggle. This is what makes Maoism scientific. Its understanding of class struggle as the material cause for the changes within any society.

That at a certain point the material productive forces come into conflict with the relations of production in society, and at that point the era of social revolution begins
Well let us see, at what point could the scales of class struggle tip? What does it take for a class system that existed to suddenly collapse for a new class system to take its place? We must once again think back to our understanding that material changes are what spur societal changes. In this case, there reaches a point at which the relations of production hold back the further development of productive forces, and this is the point at which the productive relations of class society must change, causing revolution.

Society must ultimately progress to a state of communism where classes no longer exist
What is the ultimate resolution of class struggle? Well let us see, class struggle resumes so long as there is an exploiting and an exploited class, therefore it is resolved once there is neither. This end of history is given the name of communism, and will have the end of class as we know it, creating the stateless classes society Marx called for.

Between capitalism and communism there must be a transitionary period, socialism, in which we have a dictatorship of the proletariat 
In order to build communism, we must lay the material groundwork to create the society. Knowing this, a transitory state, socialism, is necessary to lay the groundwork through concentrated efforts of the masses, and without the construction of this groundwork communism will surely fail. Socialism is the transitory state in which the forces of production are socialized and the masses, led by a vanguard party, strive to achieve and create the groundwork for a communist society. Communism, the end of history, is the abolition of class and of class struggle, the final goal of all Maoists.

With this justification for both MLM as a science and the veracity of its base axioms, we must now proceed to explain the incorrect attitudes towards it, both dogmatism and revisionism.

What is dogmatism? Dogmatism is the incorrect attitude of treating the works of the great teachers (Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Mao, and Gonzalo) as absolute truth rather than engaging in their own investigation. This attitude lacks the creative application of Maoism necessary to create true statements about society, and in the case that some of our understanding was wrong, does not allow for us to correct it. It is the duty of principled Maoists to oppose this “Book Worship”, as Mao said, and to analyze situations in their own right to form our own understanding of them. A non-maoist example could be a physicist who refuses to accept quantum physics as reality, and instead clings to the old ideas of how atoms operate.

On the other side, we have revisionism. Revisionism is an attitude in which the fundamental axioms of Marx are corrupted or changed for a myriad of reasons. Whether it be opportunism or simple misunderstanding, this attitude is unacceptable and has to be rectified in any serious party. While we must creatively apply Maoism, it must be Maoism that we are applying. Revisionism will lead to the betrayal of the construction of socialism and a return to capitalist society. An example in another discipline could be a physicist who rejects the mathematical nature of physics. 

Overall, I hope this article has defended the reputation of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism against those who would deny that it is scientific, who would not deem it a science on the same level of the natural ones, and defended its integrity against revisionists and dogmatists. Armed with this science, there is nothing on earth the working masses cannot achieve. Let us boldly go forth armed with Maoism, and fight for the liberty of the masses!
