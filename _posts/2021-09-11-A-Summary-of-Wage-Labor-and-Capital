The following paper poses a basic summary and analysis of the work "Wage Labor and Capital" by Marx. This comes in the hopes of making the works more digestible and hopefully spreading his ideas further. 

To begin, comes the extremely important example posed at the beginning of the pamphlet:

Let a worker's wage be $3 an hour. The cost of the raw materials he uses are $20 an hour, and the cost of maintenance is $1 an hour. Let us say that every hour, 1 good is produced. The good costs $27. As such, the capitalist pockets $3 of the 27 total. Now one may ask, where does the excess value come from? Well looking at analysis, $20 comes from the raw materials, $1 comes from the operating cost, therefore the excess $6 must come from the labor of a worker. However, the labor is only compensated $3 of his labor, while the capitalist extracts the other $3. 

Looking at this situation, we can see that the laborer must sell their labor power to the capitalist for a stipulated amount of time for a specific wage. Labor power is simply another commodity to be regarded as such, a commodity that is purchased in a certain quantity of "labor hours" for the price of a wage. The sole peculiar aspect of it is that is it a commodity that has the ability to generate value for a capitalist. 

This fundamental idea forms the bedrock of modern society and economy, that the working class generates all value within society, yet the upper class robs them of it. This absurdist state of affairs must not stand, it can not stand. 

To begin, let us examine what wages are, and how they are determined according to Marx. Wages are, at their most basic, the amount of wealth a capitalist pays for a certain amount of work. Laborers exchange a commodity, their labor power, for money. This money is transformed into the purchase of other commodities, therefore the laborer essentially exchanges their commodity for commodities of other kinds, such as food, clothes, etc. Wages are nothing but a special name for the price of labor power. This commodification of labor has the end result in that labor power, despite being the source of generation of value, has as little say in how much it goes to them, about as much as a machine or the raw materials. Wages are not a share in the commodity produced by the laborer, but a simple expense of already existing capital by a capitalist. Now why does the laborer sell his labor power? Simple, in order to survive. The sale of labor power is the only way a laborer can maintain their existence. The labor is not part of his life, but a sacrifice he must make for the preservation of his life. 

This was not always the case. Different economic systems had different class relations, and different forms of exploitation. For example slaves did not sell their labor power. They sold their very self and the sum of their labor power to their owner, as a commodity that could pass from hand to hand. A slave is a commodity, but their labor power is not. The serf sells a portion of his labor value in terms of tribute to the owner of his land. The free laborer sells portion of his life in the terms of labor power. 7 hours, 8 hours, 9 hours, are sold to whomever purchases them. The capitalist can discharge the labourer at his leisure, but the laborer cannot dispense with the buyer class without forsaking his own existence. The bourgeois class owns him, and it is up to him to find a buyer within it.

The laws governing wages are the same as the laws governing the value of any other commodity. Now the question is which are those laws?

The value of commodities is based on the competition of the buyers and the sellers, or the conflict between supply and demand. There is the competition between the sellers, which drives prices down as the seller who sells the product for the least is likely to gain the most customers. However there is also competition between the buyers, which drives the cost of goods up. Finally, there is the competition between the buyers and the sellers, the buyers who wish to buy low, and the sellers who wish to sell high. 

Suppose there are 100 bales of cotton and demand for 1000 bales of cotton. There is intense competition between the buyers in this case, and the sellers will work together to drive up prices to their common interests. They will collectively monopolize the supply of bales of cotton, and drive prices high. When the opposite scenario is true, the opposite occurs. The sellers have great competition, and prices are driven down. 

What is a high profit or a low profit? This is simple decided by the cost of production. If it costs $100 to create a bale of cotton, a $110 sale of it would be a reasonable price for a reasonable profit, while a sale of $200 would be considered a hearty profit, and a high price. 

Now when a commodity has a high price, capital will flood towards greater production of this commodity until the supply meets the demand, and the price returns to a reasonable level for standard profit. Meanwhile, if the opposite happens, the industry will either go out of business if it is doomed to fail, or capital will pull out until demand meets supply, and the price re-reaches the standard level. 

Therefore, if the cost of production is the standard price, we can see that the cost is the standard price of a good. However, it is important to note that the very nature of commodities creates the fluctuations in value as a law and the cost of production as the accident. It is due to this that the nature of bourgeois society is shook, as in this disorder of industrial anarchy, we can see the order of price determination. 

Thus we see that the price of a commodity is determined by the price of its production, and is balanced out by phases of high value and phases of lower values. The price of an item is determined by the cost of raw materials, the cost of maintenance, and the cost of labor power.

With this information, let us return to our original question. What laws govern the determination of wages?

So we know that the cost of labor is the cost of the production of labor power, but what is that cost?

It is the cost of his maintenance as a laborer, and the cost of his education. The more the education is, the higher the wage of the laborer. Now with examination, we see that the cost of labor is simply the cost of the existence and propagation of a laborer. For example, with a machine that breaks down after a certain amount of uses, extra must be charged for the replacement of the machine, more wages must be paid for the propagation of a worker, and the eventual replacement of the worker with another worker. 

Now, to pivot slightly, let us examine the nature and growth of capital.

Capital consists of raw materials, means of subsistence, and instruments of labor of all kinds used to create more of the aforementioned components, or so say the economists. 

To begin our examination, let us look at the process of production. In this process, human beings work upon each other to create a product. The produce only by working together in a specified manner ad entering into relationships with one another. Only within the social connections and relations does production occur. These social relations will obviously vary depending on the character of the means of production. Industrial social relations are different from feudal ones. We can derive that the relations of production are changed and developed alongside the forces of production. As the forces of production develop, societies and social relations enter different stages, each stage with distinct characteristics.

Capital is yet another social relation of production. It is the relation of production within bourgeois society. Capital does not only consist of the aforementioned definition of economists, but also exchange values. All products of which it exists are commodities. Therefore, it is not only a sum of material products, but also of commodities, of social magnitudes. It remains the same whether we replace cotton with wool, or rice with wheat. 

However, while all capital is a sum of exchange values, not all sums of exchange values are capital. What makes a sum of exchange values become capital? The fact that as an independent social power, it is able to preserve and multiply itself using existing labor power. The existence of a class that has nothing but the ability to work is a necessity of capital. It consists of the fact that living labor serves accumulated labor as a means of preserving and multiplying it.

Now let us see what is the exchange which occurs between the capitalist and the wage laborer?

The labourer receives his means of subsistence from the capitalist, and the capitalist receives labor power from the labourer. The laborer surrenders productivity to the capitalist which the laborer can now not use for themselves, and the laborer must spend what they gain on preserving their existence.

Let us take the example of a farmer. A laborer is paid $1 for working in a factor, and the factory owner gains $2 from his labor. The factory owner has gained a great deal for the $1 he paid the labourer, as he has gained double the return on his investment. Meanwhile, the labourer solely gains $1 from his productive force, which he spends on his basic needs. Those needs are then consumed and are lost forever, while the capitalist gains the wealth from the labor of the worker and is able to invest it to multiply further. The labourer can only regain the needs by selling his labor to the capitalist. Does this laborer produce only value? No! The labourer produces capital as well! This capital can be used to produce further capital.

Therefore, the bourgeois and economists maintain that the interests of both are the same. The worker perishes if capital does not keep them busy, and capital perishes if not replenished by labor. The more capital increases, the more it can expand itself, and the more labor it needs, thus increasing the demand for labor, increasing the wages of labourers. 

However to state that the interests of capital and workers are the same only means that they are two sides of the same relation. As long as a wage labourer remains a wage labourer, he is dependent on capital. As capital grows, wage labor extends over a greater number of individuals. 

A rise in wages presupposes a rapid growth in productive capital. This growth also causes a rapid increase in luxuries, social needs, and social pleasures. Therefore, while the pleasures a laborer can afford have increased, their comparative pleasures have fallen in relation to the capitalist. Since pleasures are in relation to society, they are relative. 

Wages in general are determined in two forms: Nominal wages, the amount of money paid to a labourer, and the real wages, the amount of commodities a labourer can buy with their wages.  An example could be during a famine, in which the cost of food sharply increases, meaning real wages have dropped, even if nominal wages are constant. A rise or fall of nominal wages does not necessarily mean the same for real wages, and vice versa. It is important to consider this when discussing wages. 

Real wages are determined above all in their relation to the gain of the capitalist. They are a relative quantity. Real wages express the price of labor power in relation to the price of commodities, while relative wages express the wages in relation to the value created by it, or the value that goes to the accumulation of capital.

To summarize what we know of wages, wages are not a proportion of the value of a commodity, but pre existing capital used to purchase labor power. The capitalist must replace these wages for a price of which he sells the product, to ensure a surplus. The rule must be that the price must be higher than the cost of labor, as to make a profit.

To review as well, the selling price of commodities from the view of the capitalist is in three parts

The cost of raw materials and maintenance of machines

The payment of wages

The surplus value taken by the capitalist

While the first part is replacing existing values, it makes sense in this context to compare real wages and profit as shares in the product of the worker. When we analyze this way, we see real wages may fall even while relative wages increase. Say that the means of subsistence have fallen 2/3rds in price, and wages have fallen but 1/3rd. Real wages have increased, but the capitalist is making an extra 1/3rd of the labourers value. Relative wages have fallen. This means that for a smaller amount of exchange values, the labourer must generate more. 

Now knowing this, what is the general law that relates relative wages to profit?

They simply stand in inverse proportion to each other. An increase in relative wages means a decrease in profit, and vice versa. 

It is also important to note that even with the advent of new productive machinery, nothing changes. If a new spinning machine is invented allowing a capitalist to produce twice as much of a product, the price will decrease due to a decrease in production cost, meaning now new amount of exchange values are produced. An increase in the net value owned by capitalists corresponds to an increase in the amount of accumulated labor, therefore the amount increases as the amount by which labour augments capital.

Based on this we can see that the interests of capital and wage labor are in fact diametrically opposed. The rapid growth of capital means the rapid growth of profits, meaning a decline in relative wages. To say the worker has an interest in the expansion of capital simply means that the faster capital expands, the more the crumbs fall to the workers. 

So in what manner does the growth of productive capital affect wages?

When the whole of productive capital increases, the competition between capitalists increase. This means they must sell their products for less, therefore he must produce more cheaply. To do this, he must create more extensive divisions of labor and introduce more machinery, allowing him to more efficiently extract surplus value from the working class. This process continues in an eternal arms race, in which the working class' relative wage is the loser.

Now we must further examine what this feverish adoption of new technology and division of labor has on wages. For one, the increased division leaves the laborer with simpler and simpler tasks, making the cost of his education lower, leading to his wages dropping, as cost of subsistence is lowered. This too increases the amount of wage labourers which can complete the same task, further driving down wages due to increased competition within the working class. The worker seeks to maintain the same amount of wages by either working more productively or working more hours, leading to even more competition between him and his fellow workers. 

Machinery has a similar effect on a mass scale, it eliminates skilled labourers and allows for the replacement of it with unskilled labour, leaving masses unemployed on the streets while those who still work work more productively for less. Even if the employees find new labor, it will likely be more unskilled labor that will pay less, as the tendency of the division of labor goes. 

In summary - As productive capital grows, the more the division of labor and application of machinery grow, and the more competition between labourers grows, driving down wages. The small manufacturers are also subsumed into the working class, as their small manufactory cannot survive in a world where greater scale is key to survival within a global economy. 

Finally, as the productive capital increases, the crisis which rock it increase in intensity due to the increase of its general mass. As the bourgeois find more markets to exploit, they will eventually run out and the contradictions will grow worse.

So in essence, as capital grows as does competition between workers, thus meaning that -

the interests of capital and the working class are diametrically opposed
