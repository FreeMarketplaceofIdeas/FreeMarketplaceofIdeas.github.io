President Woodrow Wilson proposed the League of Nations as a solution to the problem of
conflict, specifically in Europe, where the international influence that the nation-states held made
the wars they fought global. Most European and other nation-states joined the League, but the
United States declined. Twenty years later, Europe was locked in a desperate struggle for
survival and identity- the League had failed. This begs the question: Why had the League failed,
and how can it apply its lessons to its descendent, the UN?

The League of Nations was marked by its early successes in avoiding conflict between Greece
and Bulgaria, and Sweden and Finland over borders act as a red herring for its ultimate failure in
several axis violations throughout the world. The problem with the concept of collective security
with which the League of Nations operated is that in the world of realpolitik, nations can just as
easily opt-out of collective security easily; _there is no motivation to honour collective security
agreements without some external motivation or motivation on the part of the
organization_. Thus, while international organizations are great for resolving problems that can
easily be solved diplomatically, with no real effort on the part of the constituent nations, it
becomes a problem when certain countries need to make concessions to act. This is precisely
what happened with the policy of appeasement; (under the policy) there was really no motivation
to act, and there was a sort of lazy belief that action was undesirable and even harmful to the
nation’s interest when there was such a high cost to acting. The recommendation that I would
give is for international organizations that require some commitment to create some sort of
institution that conducts these retaliations within the organization. What this could mean for the
UN is a military that each state has to contribute to or some sort of agreement to sanction
countries that get out of line. _I do not mean for this tool to be used to coerce_, but I mean this as
an *independent* tool that intervenes when countries violate internationally ratified pieces of law
such as the Geneva Conventions. 

Another problem with the League of Nations was the lack of a disinterested superpower or
groups of disinterested powers to adjudicate the League. What I mean by that is that Europe in
the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s was a place where countries aggressively picked
alliances; almost no one stood alone. It is essential to consider that when normally non-aligned
countries start choosing sides, it is likely a sign of a coming conflict, whether economic,
diplomatic, or military. Even after its involvement in WW1, the US remained relatively
isolationist and disinterested in global politics, thus contributing to WW2, as its disinterest gave
it the perfect perch from which to judge Europe. However, the US’s (and any other disinterested
superpower’s) geographical and political isolation can contribute to a policy of appeasement, as
the Maginot did for the French and the channel to the British. Thus, policymakers must keep
somewhat (paradoxically) of an interventionist bent but a metered interventionism. Therefore,
the US’s membership in the League of Nations would not have changed much in the Second
World War due to its isolation, but it would have certainly diminished the scale of destruction
and timeframe of destruction in the war. 

Finally, the UN must use its independent institutions to enforce international law, rather than
enforce it in an ad hoc way where some powers get special privileges over others in terms of
enforcement of international law. The most challenging thing to do would be establishing
an independent institution that enforces international law, and members are motivated to stay in
the UN and participate and support it. 

We all share a desire to stop a Third World War; we do not want a conflict that is genuinely
global to cripple us all, to leave us shellshocked and raped as Europe and Asia were. Thus, we
must take a metered interventionist attitude and create buffers for expansion, channels for
diplomacy, and enforcement for the law.
